*What is this project about?*

Wanderwave is a revolutionary mobile application designed to diversify users musical experiences by transforming their daily commutes into musical adventures. By leveraging community-shared "beacons" and Spotifyâ€™s extensive music library, Wanderwave allows users to discover new genres and artists beyond their usual listening habits. The app introduces social elements such as profile and the rating of songs, encouraging users to share and rate songs within their vicinity.

Wanderwave enables users to step outside algorithm-driven recommendations from typical music services, fostering a more explorative and interactive music discovery process. Users can share music through beacons placed in real-world locations and enjoy culturally significant music tailored to their surroundings. The app supports both online and offline modes, ensuring seamless music discovery regardless of connectivity.
