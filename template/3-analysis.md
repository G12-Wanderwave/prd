# Analysis of the Situation

### Competitors

There are currently no direct competitors to Wanderwave on the market. Streaming services
such as Spotify do provide a way to discover new music through their recommendation
systems, but as stated before, those do not really offer an escape from the "bubble" of 
familiarity.

Wanderwave is, to our knowledge, the only service that allows users to share music based on
their physical location. 

It should be noted that there's not really anything protecting the concept of
location-based music sharing, and neither do we have something that only we can provide. 
This means that there is not really a way for us to stop a competitor from building upon 
our ideas and implementing them on their own, potentially using superior recources.

### Complementary products and services

A Spotify account is required for Wanderwave, as the app needs access to the authenticated
Spotify app to play music from. 

In future (post-MVP) releases, the explicit dependency on Spotify specifically might be 
removed with the addition of other music providers. However, *some* music provider will 
always be necessary to provide core functionality of the app.
