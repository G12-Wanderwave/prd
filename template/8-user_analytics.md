# User Analytics and Acceptance

*Goal: understand how users are using the app.*

*Which are the key metrics?*
Number of new users
Number of active users/Number of inactive accounts
Number of songs dropped/received
Play Store reviews
Probably not accessible via API, but there is a metric in the Spotify EOY review that shows how many new artists and genres were discovered by each user


*What is the success criteria?*
Having enough users to make the song sharing process self-sustainable. (i.e. having the tracklists in beacon changing regularly)

*What is the analysis plan (link to data collection)?*
Not clear ?

*Include relevant A/B testing ideas.*
TBD
