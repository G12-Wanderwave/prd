# Business Model

Spotify API ToS don't allow monetization


*Expected operating Costs*
Google API requests (Firebase, Maps, Places)
Advertising

*Revenue Streams*
Only possible way to make money: sell the app to Spotify
    Need to create very significant user engagement to demonstrate value
    Risky: need to invest a lot of money without any guarantees
