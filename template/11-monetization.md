# Business Model

Monetizing WanderWave poses challenges due to the restrictions imposed by Spotify's [Terms & Services](https://developer.spotify.com/policy), which prohibit generating revenue directly from their API.

### Expected Operating Costs
<ul>
  <li>_Google API Requests:_ This includes costs associated with Firebase, Maps, and Places.</li>
  <li>_Advertising Expenses:_ Budget required for promoting the app.</li>
</ul>

### Revenue Streams

#### Maintaining the Current Concept
Keeping the app's concept as is, the primary revenue generation strategy is to sell the app to Spotify. This approach requires:

<ul>
  <li>_Significant User Engagement:_ We must create a highly engaging user experience to demonstrate the app's value to Spotify.</li>
  <li>_High Investment Risk:_ Substantial upfront investment is needed, with no guarantee of a return.</li>
</ul>

#### Alternative Approach
To circumvent the restrictions imposed by Spotify, an alternative strategy would be to:

<ul>
  <li>_Remove Spotify Integration:_ Replace the Spotify API with a proprietary repository of songs, ensuring no reliance on external music providers.</li>
</ul>
  
This shift could open up other monetization avenues, such as in-app purchases, subscription models, or ad-based revenue, while staying within legal boundaries.

Both approaches have their own set of challenges and risks. The current approach aims at a high-stakes acquisition, while the alternative focuses on building a sustainable revenue model independently of Spotify.
