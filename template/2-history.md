# History

The V1 Proof of Concept was planned with the objective of validating the core idea of location-based music sharing. The focus was on creating a basic prototype that could demonstrate the functionality of dropping and retrieving songs from beacons, and the ability to play music using the Spotify API.

From the PoC, the core idea of location-based music sharing was validated. The functionality of dropping and retrieving songs from beacons and the ability to play music using the Spotify API was successfully demonstrated. Now to transition from the PoC to the MVP, the following elements need to be addressed:


1. User Interface Enhancements: The PoC had a basic UI. The MVP needs a polished and user-friendly interface.
2. Offline Mode: Implement offline functionality to allow users to interact with beacons without internet connectivity.
3. Social Features: Develop user profiles, and enable liking and disliking songs to enhance community interaction.
4. Backend Scalability: Ensure the backend can handle increased traffic and data as more users join.
5. Security and Privacy: Implement robust security measures to protect user data, complying with legal frameworks like GDPR and CCPA.
6. Analytics Integration: Set up analytics to monitor user engagement, song sharing activities, and gather feedback.
