# The Value Proposition

In today's world, it is surprisingly hard to discover new and different music you might enjoy. Most people listen to music via streaming services like YouTube, Spotify or Apple Music. While these services all present some recommendation system, they focus on tracks similar to what the user is already listening to. This forms a bubble of what the service believes the users likes, that is difficult to leave without specifically searching for other known tracks. Further, since these bubbles can be very different for members of the same community, which removes the opportunity to connect over shared music interest.

WanderWave brings back this opportunity by allowing users to discover what music other people around them are listening to. It is a mobile app integrates with Spotify to determine what users are currently listening to and exchanging these tracks with other users via virtual geo-localized beacons. By simply walking around, the user discovers what other users passed by the same places were listening to, and maybe even find a new favorite track.

WanderWave creates the following value proposition:

- For listeners, the ability to discover new music, potantially different to what they usually listen to. Especially for finding community in music, location-based sharing is crucial.

- For artists, it provides a platform of finding new listeners and fans. Because of the integration with Spotify, all plays are counted as usual when listening with Spotify and provide revenue.

- For music labels, it provides detailed location-based information of where music is listened to. This can be used for improved marketing or distribution purposes.

WanderWave is initially offered as a free service to gain an broad user base, which is essential for the service to work well. By using the Spotify API, we already have access to most tracks people listen to. Since the app can work mostly in the background, the users don't have to actively use it and can organically get more active usage as the more listeners use WanderWave.

The final business model is not yet determined, but must most likely include a partnership with a service such as Spotify, since their API currently does not allow commercial use. Potential partnerships with music labels are also possible in exchange for usage right of the collected listening data.
